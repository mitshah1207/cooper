# General Information

## Introduction
Cooper is a rescue, from the Dog's Trust. He was born around 2020 and was found as a stray in Ireland. We adopted him in Sept 2023. He is a typical border collie that needs mental and physical stimulation. He is very affectionate, loving, good with other dogs (submissive with them) and playful. He is an extremely quick learner true to his breed. 

## Daily routine (update for September 2025)
Given the paw issue, the guidance is to avoid impact / running / sliding to protect to paw and to not let it get dirty or wet. This means no off lead running or chasing objects, or going in grass/mud/water. He needs it to be kept clean 3x per day, and cone at home, and below is the routine we have developed which has worked in Sept 2025. 

To clean the paw, it is dunked into a jar containing 15mL of chlorhexidine, and 150mL of water. He either sits or stands for this, and is praised and fed throughout this process. It is dunked for 5 minutes. He then goes into a cone, and is free to walk around. 

To take the cone off unclip his collar, then gently pull off. To replace it, do so encouragingly with a lot of praise and then give one kibble once the cone is back on! 

With the cone on, he needs a modified water bowl. The bowl must be kept full at all times, as he probably can't reach the water if it's half-full! 

Weekdays:
- Cooper wakes up with you. 
- Take cone off so he can lick himself/have a bit of a break (under your supervision at all times) and replace after a few minutes.
- Take cone off once ready to go out. 
- **Give first pentoxyfilline and probiotic tablets** ([how to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV5tZ5oDc6o) and alternatively a [description](https://www.pdsa.org.uk/pet-help-and-advice/pet-health-hub/other-veterinary-advice/how-to-give-your-dog-a-pill)).
- The injured paw needs 2 poo bags, then a dog boot whenever he goes outside (tip: wear the bags on the foot, then put the boot on, then tie the bags with a knot).
- Walk (approx. 1 hr) starting anytime between 9:30-10:30am. We try to go out when the cars are _really_ low frequency.
- Once arrive home, take off boot and do the **first paw soak** with his first meal. Replace cone. 
- Generally rests with the cone on. Mid-afternoon a few times we take it off to give him a brief break, play 'hide it' for 4-5 times, then replace the cone. 
- Two-thirds (approx) of his dinner ~7pm with **second paw soak** 
- Between dinner and his evening walk he initially may rest but then has a second wave of energy and wants to play ~9pm. Take off cone again if he wants this and play hide it, and replace cone.
- Take cone off once ready to go out. **Give second pentoxyfilline and probiotic tablet**
- Bag and boot his paw, walk between 10-11pm for 30mins .. the later the better so it's quieter in terms of cars.
- Once back, **third paw soak** with the remaining one-third food.
- Sleeps when we do in variable locations, usually by our bed.
  
## Feeding
### Main meals:
- Twice per day (as per [Daily routine](#daily-routine)), Purina, 135g morning, 135g evening.
  
### If unwell
- **The first signs of mucus in his poo or loose poo** needs him to starve for 10-12 hours subsequently, then be fed bland diet (the GI diet tin) + prokolin (+/- panacur)
- Feed a bland diet: 290kCal from potato (440g boiled unskinned potato) + 290kCal from fish (310g baked white fish) = 580kCal per meal (he doesn't like rice) OR use the GI diet cans (2 per day). Feed these 2 meals of the day in 4 parts throughout the day.
- Also, give 5-6mL Prokolin twice per day. This is best done with the pill method ([how to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV5tZ5oDc6o) and alternatively a [description](https://www.pdsa.org.uk/pet-help-and-advice/pet-health-hub/other-veterinary-advice/how-to-give-your-dog-a-pill)) by 'scraping' most of the paste behind his teeth, he then realises he likes the taste and will lick the rest from your fingers, or if feeding just put it on top of the food. 
- See also [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

### Treats / long-lasting chews
- Fish / vegetarian based only (he doesn't tolerate chicken / other things)
- He needs supervision whilst chewing in case he chokes (never happened before) and access to water afterwards. 

## Toilet
- Usually goes twice per day and can last 10-12 hours comfortably without problem. Well toilet trained.
- Poos twice often during a walk (morning) and usually once at night.
- No accidents at home, however the first 1-2 times he is in a new home setting he will attempt to urine mark (possibly as he's uncastrated). We have nappies for this, although lately he hasn't done this at all.
- Will let you know if he needs to desperately go by scratching on the main door or banging on this (has happened a few times if he has a stomach bug)

## Play
- Will chase a ball endlessly if chucked (and wouldn't know when to stop) - we therefore don't encourage non-stop throws. 
- See also [Guide to the outdoors](#guide-to-the-outdoors)
- At home, we have started a new style of play. If he brings a toy to play with, we may occasionally throw it to start with, which he then retrieves. However, rapidly we would move to a more exhausting / stimulating game which is to (1) Get him to go 'down' in a spot, and say 'stay' (2) You then slowly move away with the toy in question and hide it somewhere out of view (3) You then say 'find it!' and he goes to search for it until he finds it. This is far better than just throwing/retrieving for the same period of time, and wears him out. 
- Often say 'all done, game over' whilst doing the motion.
- Does not know how to tug 

## Sleep 
- Cooper sleeps on the floor next to our bed. It would be good if he can sleep in the same room as you. He is allowed on the bed but rarely goes on it, and doesn't make use of his own dog bed either! 
N.B. Important that the doors are not shut in the room he is in.

# Challenges

## Challenges whilst indoors
No obvious challenges encountered. Incessant want to play is perhaps the biggest challenge. If he's tired from the walk/play session especially after a few good days of activity, he will leave you alone and just rest. 'Find it' is the best game, not chucking the toy indoors as this wouldn't really tire him out. 

## Challenges outdoors
Wants to chase or herd cars when outside. We are trying to overcome this by the following:
- Walking him when there's low traffic and on streets with low volume traffic only
- Starting to say 'leave it' firmly if he is fixating on a car
- Sometimes it helps to stop and wait for the traffic to pass. He can be gven treats at the same time for leaving it, whilst saying 'leave it' then praising, then re-focussing on you by saying 'look at me'.

Pulling on lead
- If pulls we do an instant 180 degrees, walk a variable distance back and then do another 180 back to where we were going. He's slowly learning but work in progress. In future we will try teaching a heel or using a halti. Will pull a lot with traffic and when he thinks he's about to play (e.g., entering the park)

# The Outdoors

## Guide to the outdoors
**Walking on residential roads**
- Currently we just focus on him not pulling (see above)

**Walking in green areas: much easier!**
- Use the yellow 5m lead but is actually quite good off lead and will come back if called "Cooper come!".

**Playing in the park: avoid unless we have given instruction**
- In the park, we use the green harness, to which we attach the 5 metre lead.  
  - He has reasonably good recall, especially if you are holding the ball in the launcher. The command is a sharp and firm 'Cooper come!'. 
  - **Cooper doesn't mind other dogs coming up to him but equally does not really enjoy it either**. He does not want to actively meet dogs often and wants to only play with you and chase the ball. If a large dog comes up this can feel intimidating for him, hence he may become defensive and get stressed. **We use a three second rule with dogs**. He can sniff for 3s then we say "Cooper come" (the recall phrase) whilst being prepared to tug towards us on the long lead to remove him from that situation. 

Playing style:
- His fetch is nearly 100% perfect.
- We nearly always get him to do 'touch' (say 'touch!' + holding our open palm out at thigh level) -> he will run to touch the palm from afar -> we throw the ball to reward him
- We also do 'middle' (say 'middle' + stand with legs apart -> he returns and runs through the middle of your legs -> we throw the ball
- We don't do non-stop fetching. We may do four of the above, then say 'go sniff' or 'go walk' so he has a break from exercise and just goes to explore the environment/go to the toilet. He will keep looking back and we repeat 'go walk' until we feel it's time to start playing again (maybe 5 minutes later).
- He needs water in a bowl during longer play sessions.

# Behaviour and Medical

## Negative commands:
Note: we generally use [positive reinforcement](https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/positive-reinforcement-training) approaches. We would try our very best not to resort to using the following negative commands, as much as possible, especially with this sensitive dog.
- A gentle 'no' to discourage a bad behaviour - **"uh-uh"**
- A firm 'no' if he does something seriously bad - **"NO."** in a sharp and assertive manner.
- **"Get off"** if somewhere he should not be. **"Off"** if he jumps on people and you don't want it or is trying to climb on you while you eat.
    
## Banned behaviours:
Not allowed to...
- **Steal food.** If food dropped whilst preparing in kitchen, has to look at you and only proceed to eating if you say: 'yes get it, good boy'. 

## Troubleshooting:

| Behaviour                              | Likely cause + likely action to take                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Incessant play | 'All done, game over' whilst wiping hands together|
| Not eating meal | Could be unwell - feed bland diet - see - See also [If unwell](#if-unwell)|
