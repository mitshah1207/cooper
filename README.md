# General Information

## Introduction
Cooper is a rescue, from the Dog's Trust. He was born around 2020 and was found as a stray in Ireland. We adopted him in Sept 2023. He is a typical border collie that needs mental and physical stimulation. He is very affectionate, loving, good with other dogs (submissive with them) and playful. He is an extremely quick learner true to his breed. 

## Daily routine
Weekdays:
- Wake up ~7-8am
- Until the walk, he is keen to play with the ball. We would chuck this a number of times before saying the 'all done' command
- Walk (approx. 1 - 1.5 hrs) starting anytime between 9:30-10:30am. We try to go out when the cars are really low frequency. 2x per week we would walk to the park for an approx 45 minute fetch session.
- Then he takes his first meal of the day ~11-12am - in a bowl / Kong Wobbler. **Give probiotic, by hand feeding with some kibble**
- Generally sleeps or rests until dinner
- Dinner ~7pm (either with tricks / hand feed / Kong Wobbler / feeder bowl) **Give probiotic, by hand feeding with some kibble**
- Between dinner and his evening walk he initially may rest but then has a second wave of energy and wants to play ~9pm (ensure his last meal was at least one hour ago to prevent any gut problems). We would throw the ball from this point for him to retrieve. If we aren't resting we would do this with tricks and reward the trick with the ball throw. Finish play session with 'all done' command, and we are trying to use 'settle' as a phrase to now rest and lie down.  
- Walk between 10-11pm ... the later the better so it's quieter in terms of cars.
- Sleeps when we do in variable locations, mostly in the same room with us. Doesn't sleep on the bed, might jump on it in the morning to greet you.

Weekends:
- We usually don't work on weekends and aim to do a 2-3 hour walk in nature (e.g. Richmond Park, Surrey Hills). This is to somewhat 'make up' for a slightly urban set of weekdays for Cooper. If he gets more time playing in the park than typical throughout the week, we can dial this down.
  
## Feeding
**Main meals:**
- Twice per day (after morning walk and 6-7pm), Purina, 170g morning, 150g evening.
- OPTION 1: hand feeding (giving him kibble piece by piece whilst stroking him and being affectionate) and part trick training. Important not to trick train too much as can stress out. We aim to do 3-5 minutes of trick training, starting and ending with an easy trick (e.g. sit, down, high five). Normally do it with the dinner.
- OPTION 2: feed meal through Kong wobbler, normally the morning meal after the walk. 
- OPTION 3: give it for 'free' in a slow feeder bowl.
- **If unwell**, feed a bland diet: 290kCal from potato (440g boiled unskinned potato)+ 290kCal from chicken (211g boiled chicken) = 580kCal per meal (he doesn't like rice) 
- See also [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

**Treats**:
Tends to find the outdoors more exciting than treats however working on giving a treat (Salmon pate) when he sees a car and remains calm. Can be used at home for training, especially "ongoing" things like settle 

**Long lasting chews** 
- He needs supervision whilst chewing in case he chokes (never happened before) and access to water afterwards. 
- Can take 30-60 minutes to get through and will calm down. **One per day as required.**

## Toilet
- Usually goes twice per day and can last 10-12 hours comfortably without problem. Well toilet trained.
- Poos twice often during a walk (morning) and usually once at night.
- No accidents at home, however the first 1-2 times he is in a new home setting he will attempt to urine mark (possibly as he's uncastrated). We have nappies for this (**take off when going outside!**)

## Play
- Will chase a ball endlessly if chucked (and wouldn't know when to stop).
- See also [Guide to the outdoors](#guide-to-the-outdoors)
- At home, we have started a new style of play. If he brings a toy to play with, we may occasionally throw it to start with, which he then retrieves. However, rapidly we would move to a more exhausting / stimulating game which is to (1) Get him to go 'down' in a spot, and say 'stay' (2) You then slowly move away with the toy in question and hide it somewhere out of view (3) You then say 'find it!' and he goes to search for it until he finds it. This is far better than just throwing/retrieving for the same period of time, and wears him out. 
- Often say 'all done, game over' whilst doing the motion.
- Does not know how to tug 

## Sleep 
- Cooper sleeps on the floor next to our bed. It would be good if he can sleep in the same room as you. He is allowed on the bed but rarely goes on it, and doesn't make use of his own dog bed either! 
N.B. Important that the doors are not shut in the room he is in.

# Challenges

## Challenges whilst indoors
No obvious challenges encountered. Incessant want to play is perhaps the biggest challenge. If he's tired from the walk/play session especially after a few good days of activity, he will leave you alone and just rest. 

## Challenges outdoors
Wants to chase or herd cars when outside. We are trying to overcome this by the following:
- Walking him when there's low traffic and on streets with low volume traffic only
- Starting to say 'leave it' firmly if he is fixating on a car
- Sometimes it helps to stop and wait for the traffic to pass. He can be gven treats at the same time for leaving it.

Pulling on lead
- If pulls we do an instant 180 degrees, walk a variable distance back and then do another 180 back to where we were going. He's slowly learning but work in progress. In future we will try teaching a heel or using a halti. Will pull a lot with traffic and when he thinks he's about to play (e.g., entering the park)

# The Outdoors

## Guide to the outdoors
**Walking on residential roads**
- Currently we just focus on him not pulling (see above)

**Walking in green areas: much easier!**
- Use the yellow 5m lead but is actually quite good off lead and will come back if called "Cooper come!".

**Playing in the park: avoid unless we have given instruction**
- In the park, we use the green harness, to which we attach the 5 metre lead.  
  - He has reasonably good recall, especially if you are holding the ball in the launcher. The command is a sharp and firm 'Cooper come!'. 
  - **Cooper doesn't mind other dogs coming up to him but equally does not really enjoy it either**. He does not want to actively meet dogs often and wants to only play with you and chase the ball. If a large dog comes up this can feel intimidating for him, hence he may become defensive and get stressed. **We use a three second rule with dogs**. He can sniff for 3s then we say "Cooper come" (the recall phrase) whilst being prepared to tug towards us on the long lead to remove him from that situation. 

Playing style:
- His fetch is nearly 100% perfect and he will tend to come back half the distance and drop it.
- We nearly always get him to do 'touch' (say 'touch!' + holding our open palm out at thigh level) -> he will run to touch the palm from afar -> we throw the ball to reward him
- We also do 'middle' (say 'middle' + stand with legs apart -> he returns and runs through the middle of your legs -> we throw the ball
- We don't do non-stop fetching. We may do four of the above, then say 'go sniff' or 'go walk' so he has a break from exercise and just goes to explore the environment/go to the toilet. He will keep looking back and we repeat 'go walk' until we feel it's time to start playing again (maybe 5 minutes later).
- He needs water in a bowl during longer play sessions.

# Behaviour and Medical

## Negative commands:
Note: we generally use [positive reinforcement](https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/positive-reinforcement-training) approaches. We would try our very best not to resort to using the following negative commands, as much as possible, especially with this sensitive dog.
- A gentle 'no' to discourage a bad behaviour - **"uh-uh"**
- A firm 'no' if he does something seriously bad - **"NO."** in a sharp and assertive manner.
- **"Get off"** if somewhere he should not be. **"Off"** if he jumps on people and you don't want it or is trying to climb on you while you eat.
    
## Banned behaviours:
Not allowed to...
- **Steal food.** If food dropped whilst preparing in kitchen, has to look at you and only proceed to eating if you say: 'yes get it, good boy'. 

## Troubleshooting:

| Behaviour                              | Likely cause + likely action to take                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Incessant play | 'All done, game over' whilst wiping hands together|
| Not eating meal | Could be unwell - feed bland diet. Or not hungry/keen, in which case give smaller portions several times and in particular he is better at eating small amounts for doing tricks (i.e. 'earning' his meal). However he will often in this situation not eat the entire meal through these means. Other options thereafter can include enhancing the small portion using small bits of cheese to entice eating, or pour boiling water over the kibble and let cool and offer. Note, another thing we notice is if he's had half his dinner earlier, he will eat the remaining food overnight if it's left within his reach, so best to have him sleeping with such access. |

## Additional notes Feb 2025
- Nail broken in left foot (the one that's brown and white) led to infection of that nail bed, which then resolved but led to a dewclaw skin fold infection. He completed antibiotics in Jan for this. He has been wearing a cone since mid-November indoors. This is extremely important because he cannot lick his paws (though we have not noticed him doing so for the past few weeks). We take this off for periods when we can definitely see what he's doing most times, and stop him licking if that were to occur (e.g when we are relaxing, and so is he, and we can see he's not licking). Take cone off for outdoor activity. He sleeps in the cone. 

Suggested routine as follows:
- Wake up, take cone off to let him lick his privates and move around, then replace
- Take out for morning walk. Note he was off running for about 2 months so he is a bit easier to tire and also he is slightly more anxious with cars. No long walks on streets, suggest simply going to nearby park, let him run around and enjoy the freedom and get back.
- Once back, wipe the dewclaw with diluted 'hibiscrub' (! part to 5, it is usually just a small drop) and a clean sterile swab.
- Feed meal (with a probiotic, break it in half and give a few kibble with each half)
- Put cone back on until the evening
- Take off cone for evening meal (with another probiotic) and then replace (or keep off if you can keep an eye on him)
- Take for night walk ideally in low traffic environment as the car lights / noises are irritating for him (maybe the green area behind your flat)
- When home, put cone back on for the night.
