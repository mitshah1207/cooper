## Daily routine
- Wake up ~7-8am
- Until the walk, he is keen to play with the ball. We would chuck this a number of times before saying the 'all done' command
- Walk (approx. 1 - 1.5 hrs) starting anytime between 9:30-10:30am. We try to go out when the cars are really low frequency.
- Then he takes his first meal of the day ~11-12am - in a bowl
- Generally sleeps or rests until dinner
- Dinner ~7pm (either with tricks or hand feed)
- Between dinner and his evening walk he initially may rest but then has a second wave of energy and wants to play ~9pm. We would throw the ball from this point for him to retrieve. If we aren't resting we would do this with tricks and reward the trick with the ball throw. Finish play session with 'all done' command, and we are trying to use 'settle' as a phrase to now rest and lie down.  
- Walk between 10-11pm ... the later the better so it's quieter in terms of cars.
- Sleeps when we do in variable locations, mostly in the same room with us. Doesn't sleep on the bed, might jump on it in the morning to greet you.

## Feeding
**Main meals:**
- Twice per day (after morning walk and 6-7pm), Purina, 150g each time.
- OPTION 1: hand feeding (giving him kibble piece by piece whilst stroking him and being affectionate) and part trick training. Important not to trick train too much as can stress out. We aim to do 3-5 minutes of trick training, starting and ending with an easy trick (e.g. sit, down, high five). Normally do it with the dinner.
- OPTION 2: feed meal through Kong wobbler, normally the morning meal after the walk. 
- OPTION 3: give it for 'free' in a slow feeder bowl. 

**Treats**:
Tends to find the outdoors more exciting than treats however working on giving a treat (Salmon pate) when he sees a car and remains calm. Can be used at home for training, especially "ongoing" things like settle 

**Long lasting chews** 
- He needs supervision whilst chewing in case he chokes (never happened before) and access to water afterwards. 
- Can take 30-60 minutes to get through and will calm down. **One per day as required.**

## Toilet
- Usually goes twice per day and can last 10-12 hours comfortably without problem. Well toilet trained.
- Poos twice often during a walk (morning) and usually once at night.
- No accidents at home, however the first 1-2 times he is in a new home setting he will attempt to urine mark (possibly as he's uncastrated). **Take off when going outside!**

## Play
- Will chase a ball endlessly if chucked. We would always try and get a command out of him before throwing ("touch", "middle", "ball"). We limit it to 5 mins at a time, and state 'all done' wiping our hands together to signal the game is over. Often say 'all done, game over' whilst doing the motion.
- Does not know how to tug 

## Sleep 
N.B. Important that the doors are not shut in the room he is in.

## Challenges whilst indoors
No obvious challenges encountered. Incessant want to play is perhaps the biggest challenge. If he's tired from the walk/play session especially after a few good days of activity, he will leave you alone and just rest. 

## Challenges outdoors
Wants to chase or herd cars when outside. We are trying to overcome this by the following:
- Walking him when there's low traffic and on streets with low volume traffic only
- Starting to say 'leave it' firmly if he is fixating on a car
- Sometimes it helps to stop and wait for the traffic to pass. He can be gven treats at the same time for leaving it.

Pulling on lead
- If pulls we do an instant 180 degrees, walk a variable distance back and then do another 180 back to where we were going. He's slowly learning but work in progress. In future we will try teaching a heel or using a halti. Will pull a lot with traffic and when he thinks he's about to play (e.g., entering the park)

## Guide to the outdoors
**Walking on residential roads**
- Currently we just focus on him not pulling (see above)

**Walking in green areas: much easier!**
- Use the yellow 5m lead but is actually quite good off lead and will come back if called "Cooper come!".

**Playing in the park: avoid unless we have given instruction**
- In the park, we use the green harness, to which we attach the 5 metre lead.  
  - He has reasonably good recall, especially if you are holding the ball in the launcher. The command is a sharp and firm 'Cooper come!'. 
  - **Cooper doesn't mind other dogs coming up to him but equally does not really enjoy it either**. He does not want to actively meet dogs often and wants to only play with you and chase the ball. If a large dog comes up this can feel intimidating for him, hence he may become defensive and get stressed. **We use a three second rule with dogs**. He can sniff for 3s then we say "Cooper come" (the recall phrase) whilst being prepared to tug towards us on the long lead to remove him from that situation. 

Playing style:
- His fetch is nearly 100% perfect and he will tend to come back half the distance and drop it. 
- We nearly always get him to do 'touch' (holding our open palm out at thigh level) and he will run to touch the palm which is excellent behaviour and will accordingly by rewarded by you throwing the ball! Another command he's happy to follow is 'middle' (stand with legs somewhat apart so he can return and come through the middle of your legs - watch your legs as he'll have the yellow lead on). Another option is 'ball', holding out the launcher with the ball, he touches the ball.
- He can play in the park forever but we limit this to 1 hour at a max. He needs water in a bowl during longer play sessions. We try to mix up play time with exploring/sniffing, but it's better to start and end with play time to get him more tired out.

## Negative commands:
Note: we generally use [positive reinforcement](https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/positive-reinforcement-training) approaches. We would try our very best not to resort to using the following negative commands, as much as possible, especially with this sensitive dog.
- A gentle 'no' to discourage a bad behaviour - **"uh-uh"**
- A firm 'no' if he does something seriously bad - **"NO."** in a sharp and assertive manner.
- **"Get off"** if somewhere he should not be. **"Off"** if he jumps on people and you don't want it or is trying to climb on you while you eat.
    
## Banned behaviours:
Not allowed to...
- **Steal food.** If food dropped whilst preparing in kitchen, has to look at you and only proceed to eating if you say: 'yes get it, good boy'. 

## Troubleshooting:

| Behaviour                              | Likely cause + likely action to take                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Incessant play | 'All done, game over' whilst wiping hands together|
